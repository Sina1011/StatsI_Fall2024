#3. identical elements
#The coefficient for q_2_residuals in q_4_regression (0.2569) is identical
#to the coefficient for presvote in q_5_regression (0.2569).
# q_4_regression is regressing the residuals of voteshare ~ difflog on the
#residuals of presvote ~ difflog.
#This isolates the effect of presvote on voteshare, controlling for difflog.
#In q_5_regression, both difflog and presvote are directly included
#in the model, so the effect of presvote is similarly isolated.
#For this reason the standard error and t-value for presvote in q_5_regression
#match the standard error and t-value for q_2_residuals in q_4_regression.
#This is because these statistics are derived from the same underlying
#relationship between voteshare and presvote, while controlling for difflog.
#The residuals summaries are also identical because both models produce
#residuals based on the relationship between voteshare and the variables
#difflog and presvote.
#tldr coefficient, standard error and t-value for presvote and the
#residuals summary statistics are identical
#because, in both regressions, the effect of presvote on voteshare is isolated
#while controlling for difflog, either by using residuals (q_4_regression)
#or by including both variables in a multivariate regression (q_5_regression).
